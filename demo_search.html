            Dear Norwell Residents and Community Members,

            As we look at the population trends across the Commonwealth and in Norwell, it’s clear that
            communities need to be positioned to address the unique needs of an ever-changing older
            adult population. I am pleased to present the report Aging in Norwell: A Community Needs
            Assessment , researched and written by the expert team at the University of Massachusetts
            Boston Gerontology Institute . This report is the result of many months of coordination and
            planning both within the community and with outside partners. While this initiative may be
            new to some, over the last year, many of Norwell’s residents, community and municipal
            leaders shared their time to participate in various discussion groups and surveys. I’m grateful
            to everyone who shared their insights, opinions, and ideas during this process.

            The purpose of the project was to assess the needs and preferences of Norwell’s adult
            residents. While we know there are challenges in supporting older residents as they age in
            our community, there are also great opportunities for innovation. The study will aid the
            Council on Aging in setting priorities, developing both short and long term plans, and
            implementing specific strategies related to services, programming, outreach, space, staffing,
            and budgeting. We also hope that the information will influence other municipal
            departments, Town and community leaders with future planning, to improve how older
            residents live and thrive in Norwell.

            On behalf of the Council on Aging, thank you to everyone who was involved in this
            assessment and shared their insight on how to make the Town of Norwell, including the
            Council on Aging’s Senior Center, a strong and vibrant place to be. We are grateful to the
            Gerontology Institute, specifically Caitlin Coyle, PhD, and her team—from coordinators and
            graduate research assistants to undergraduate interns— for doing an outstanding job on this
            project. Thank you to the Massachusetts Executive Office of Elder Affairs for providing
            financial support to conduct this assessment. And finally, I thank to the Council on Aging
            Board and the community at large for your ongoing support, vision, and engagement. I hope
            you enjoy reading this report and are inspired to engage in the community as we truly make
            Norwell a place for all ages!

            Sincerely,
            Susan Curtin

            1 Executive Summary

            This report describes research undertaken by the Center for Social & Demographic Research
            on Aging within the Gerontology Institute at the University of Massachusetts Boston, on
            behalf of the Norwell Council on Aging. The goals of this project were to investigate the needs,
            interests, preferences, and opinions of Norwell’s residents age 50 or older. The contents of
            this report are meant to inform the Town of Norwell, the Norwell Council on Aging and
            Senior Center, and organizations that work with and on behalf of older residents of Norwell
            for the purposes of planning and coordination of services. The report will also help to build
            awareness about issues facing Norwell among community members at large.

            Already, estimates suggest that 35% of Norwell’s population is age 50 or older and this trend
            stands to continue. This results from a number of factors—that adults who have lived and
            made Norwell home want to continue living in the community with which they are familiar
            and near to their family and friends and perhaps residents who are moving to Norwell to be
            closer to adult children or grandchildren. Another contributing factor includes the out-
            migration of young people seeking employment, education, or lower costs of living
            elsewhere. Regardless of the reason, this central overarching observation—that the older
            population of Norwell is already large and will continue to expand—makes clear the
            importance of considering how well features of the Town, the services and amenities
            available, and virtually every aspect of the community align with the age demographic
            moving forward.

            In preparing for this demographic shift, the Norwell Council on Aging and the Center for
            Social and Demographic Research on Aging at the University of Massachusetts Boston
            partnered to conduct a study to investigate the needs, interests, preferences, and opinions of
            the Town’s residents age 50 and older. As part of this assessment, we conducted interviews
            and focus groups to hear from Norwell leadership, key stakeholders in the community, and
            a diverse group of residents. In addition, a survey was developed and administered to year-
            round Norwell residents age 50 and older. A total of 1,081 questionnaires were returned,
            reflecting a strong return rate of 25%. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other sources
            were examined in support of the project aims.

            A broad range of findings are reported in this document, highlighting the many positive
            features of Norwell as well as concerns expressed by older residents. The COA plays an
            important leadership role in the community, serving as a resource to other Town offices
            and organizations working in the community, and collaborating on initiatives broadly
            beneficial to residents. The 2022 Needs Assessment process coincided with the Norwell
            Senior Center’s 40th birthday. Town leaders and residents gathered to celebrate the COA’s


            2 40-year impact on the community and look forward to the future. The COA also launched
            their Dementia Friendly initiative in 2022, in response to planning needs related to the
            increasing prevalence of dementia, and other health challenges associated with aging. This
            needs assessment will inform the COA, and collaborative partners, in planning that builds
            upon the success of past efforts and continues to benefit the community of Norwell.

            While many of our findings, and the recommendations that follow, intersect with the scope
            of responsibility of the Norwell Council on Aging, it is understood that responding to many
            needs and concerns expressed in the community will require the involvement of other
            municipal offices or community stakeholders, and some will require substantial
            collaborative effort.

            We summarize key findings and make the following recommendations to the Norwell
            Council on Aging:
             Residents view the Norwell COA as a vital resource to the community, both now
            and in the future. Continued support and expanded space could grow its impact in
            the community.
            o 75% of survey respondents affirmed that the Norwell COA plays a role in the lives of
            themselves, their loved ones, or neighbors.
            o Among respondents that wrote in their thoughts on the Norwell COA, about one-
            third mentioned that the Norwell COA is doing great things; and is only limited by is
            physical space.
             One respondent wrote, “ the current COA does a great job with what they have to
            work with but the facility is inadequate. The physical space does not encourage active
            participation or desire to even participate among town residents ."
            o Many survey respondents wrote in about the fact that they do not currently
            participate at the Norwell COA; but they plan to in the future and are comforted to
            know about its operations.
            o One respondent illustrated this sentiment by writing, “… when I am retired…I
            will use their services. But I am so glad to have them in Town .”
            o The desire, among Town staff and residents, to address capacity and scheduling
            limitations at the Senior Center is reflected in collective planning to create a
            Community Center in Norwell.
            o More than half (55%) of survey respondents would support a
            multigenerational community center where space and programming are
            integrated for residents of all ages.






            3 Recommendations:
            o Plan for escalating demand for Senior Center programs and services –including the
            expansion of both staffing and space.
            o Advocate for more dedicated space for older adult programming. Specifically, space
            to accommodate lifelong learning courses and exercise programs is needed to meet
            the current and future preferences of Norwell residents.
            o As the space for additional programming becomes available, expand the
            programming staff to include an additional “activities coordinator” position that
            assists with scheduling and planning the programming aspects of the Senior Center.
             Demand for community-based social programs and access to information and
            referral services is expected to escalate in coming years.
            o Estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau show that in 2021, there were 2,073 residents
            age 60 or older living in Norwell—comprising 19% of the total population.
            Projections suggest that by 2030, nearly 33% of Norwell will be age 60 or older. Local
            census numbers from 2022 indicate that 2,792 of Norwell residents (25%) is age 60
            or older—suggesting that the community is on its way towards this increasing older
            adult population
            o Not only is the size of the older population growing in Norwell, but the complexity of
            their needs is increasing. In addition to basic needs (food, housing, transportation),
            participants identified lifelong learning, access to arts and culture, and maintaining
            physical health as key elements of community living.
             Among survey respondents in their 50s, 60s, and 70s, the most important
            service offered by the Norwell COA is professional services like health
            insurance counseling, access to a notary etc. For those in their 80s, the most
            important program currently offered are the meal programs
            (e.g., lunches, grab ‘n’ go meals).
             In-home support services and information and referral services were named
            as priorities for expanding services offered by the Norwell COA by nearly half
            of respondents who currently participate at the Norwell COA (48%; 49%
            respectively) and were also the top two priorities for those who do not use the
            Norwell COA (47%; 42% respectively).

            Recommendations:
            o Currently, the Norwell Senior Center provides the only public social services in the
            Town. As needs for social services are expected to increase in quantity and
            complexity, address the need for additional resources to provide mental and
            behavioral health support for current and future older residents and their families.


            4  Consider monthly discussion panels with the Community Services coordinator
            and guest speakers. Explore a partnership with a local university to enlist
            social work interns who can support social service staff
             Having more outreach staff dedicated to community outreach and education
            could widen awareness of the Senior Center’s offerings. Consider an
            informational insert in a utility bill to inform residents of how to access
            programs such as the confidential application process to learn about the
            Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
             The perception of the Norwell COA is that it is “needs-based”—which deters
            participation.
            o 65% of survey respondents report never participating at the Norwell COA. Among
            those 35% who do, most of them (63%) report only participating a few times a year.
            o For those in their 50s and 60s, most respondents report that the number one reason
            why they do NOT participate at the Norwell COA is because they are working or
            because they are not old enough. For those in their 70s and 80s, the number one
            reason was “other”, and they wrote in a reason in their own words.
             For those who wrote in a response, the most common responses centered on
            “not needing” to visit the Senior Center or “not being interested” in what goes
            on at the Senior Center, suggesting that communicating the purpose of the
            Senior Center and defining its target audience is a possible future step that
            could draw in a wider range of residents.
            o Similarly, among respondents in their 50s and 60s, having more knowledge about
            what is offered would increase the likelihood of participation. For those in their 70s
            and 80s, having programs that were better suited to their interests would make it
            more likely for them to participate at the Norwell COA.
            o Respondents used terms like “stigma” and “negative context” “think of the COA as an
            organization for the very needy” to describe what prevents them and their peers from
            participating. These sentiments suggest that a “reinvention” of the Norwell COA is
            needed to continue attracting residents as they age.

            Recommendations:
            o Consider changing the name to be more inclusive. Creating an image that reframes
            aging as a positive and active experience may empower residents to participate.
             Consider soliciting ideas for a new name by facilitating a Town-wide contest.
            o Form an ambassadors program where informed residents can promote the COA to
            their networks and clarify the offerings of the Norwell COA.


            5 o Continue to grow partnerships with the library, local businesses, and schools to help
            meet the needs for additional programming opportunities targeted for older adults
            and offer intergenerational opportunities.
             Consider occupying a table or two at a local coffee shop or the library and
            offer “technology drop-in” help for residents looking to learn more about
            their devices or how to hone their technology skills. Consider recruiting local
            residents with technology backgrounds to serve as the coaches.

             Continued input from residents is needed to ensure that programming aligns
            with interests of the community. As well, outreach and education about the broad
            range of available programs is an ongoing effort.
            o For those in their 50s, 60s, and 80s the most important program offered is fitness
            activities and for those in their 70s, educational opportunities were most important.
            The Senior Center currently offers a variety of on-site classes and virtual learning via
            Zoom. Norwell’s Senior Center was the first in Massachusetts to partner with the
            Senior Learning Network in 2013.
            o When asked about future desires, respondents who currently use the Norwell COA
            would like to see more day trips and meal programs—particularly the grab ‘n’ go
            meals. For those who do not currently use the Norwell COA, indoor and outdoor
            exercise were most commonly reported, followed by a desire for performances and
            visual arts programming.
            o Given the opportunity to write in their own ideas, respondents focused on programs
            that enabled them to develop or hone a skill (e.g., woodworking, gardening, cooking,
            cheese making, or business) and holistic wellness and mental health promotional
            programs (e.g., mindfulness, meditation, Reiki, massage).

            Recommendations:
            o Advocate for new space that includes ample space for indoor exercise classes that can
            accommodate large groups and offers access to exercise equipment (e.g., weights,
            stationary bikes etc.). Also consider a walking track that is available to all residents.
            o Consider a community wide contest that provides an opportunity for residents to
            share programming ideas that reflect their interests and talents.
            o Extend the satellite model to the business community through a partnership with
            the local Chamber of Commerce to increase socialization, while supporting local
            business infrastructure.
             Explore opportunities with local restaurants and performance theaters such
            as The Company Theater or the Duxbury Performing Arts Center to create
            dine and engage events that include lectures, entertainment, and wellness
            programs.


            6 o Build upon existing and successful efforts to expand outdoor programming through
            the creation of an “outdoor explorers” initiative.
             Construct, or incorporate at an existing playground, intergenerational fitness
            and play features with accessible gathering spaces for residents of all ages
            and abilities.
             Consider a walking trail or labyrinth; partner with the Recreation
            department or local businesses to offer outdoor yoga and meditation
            programs; kayaking and hiking.
            o Coordinate with residents to identify topics and skills they can share with others and
            pilot-test a lifelong learning program.
             Perhaps COA Board members could facilitate special interest groups to
            develop programs.
             Consider a series, or otherwise ongoing program, with the Norwell Public
            Library that would function like a course for residents.
            o Continue to build upon successful intergenerational engagement with the schools.
            Consider a “Reverse Mentorship” or a “Sages and Seekers”1 program. Create and
            publicize shared theater, educational, and recreation events among residents.
            Consider an intergenerational book club, debate team, or choir group that is led by
            adult mentors.

            Rising property taxes and related housing costs is causing financial insecurity for
            older residents—causing many to leave the community.
            o Cost of living, particularly rising property taxes, is named as a top concern among
            respondents as they think about being able to stay in Norwell as they age.
             One respondent illustrated this by writing that, “ I can’t afford to live here in
            retirement …”
            o One out of five residents age 65 or older is living on less than $50,000/year. This is
            compared to just 6% of those age 45-64.

            Recommendations:
            o Continue to promote awareness of existing property tax relief programs including:
            the local senior circuit breaker abatement that was adopted at Town Meeting, 2022
            and tax work off program. There are between 30 and 45 people enrolled in the
            property tax work off program each year.
             Document the number of residents who are “turned away” from existing
            programs due to eligibility requirements or other reasons to measure unmet
            needs and establish recommendations for expanding eligibility or creating
            new solutions.

            1 https://sagesandseekers.org


            7  Broaden awareness of financial support programs through an informational
            insert in a utility bill and highlighted section on the Council on Aging website.
            Create an email that includes a website link for other town departments to
            share with their distribution lists.
            o Enlist local builders, landscapers or contractors to support the Council on Aging’s
            recently launched Norwell Neighbors, a volunteer based home repair resource
            network.
            o Explore other cash or discount incentive programs for volunteers.
             There is a longstanding need to expand and diversify housing options in Norwell.
            In addition to new development, continued support for modifications to existing
            homes and properties will contribute to affordable, supportive, and accessible
            housing inventory.
            o 46% of respondents do not have a bedroom and a bathroom on the entry level of their
            current home—an important feature as occupants age and mobility becomes more
            challenging.
            o 41% report needing a home repair or modification in the near future to be able to age
            in place safely. Among them, 11% report not being able to afford such changes.

            Recommendations
            o Foster development of Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), a housing solution that is
            allowed by right in Norwell since the adoption of zoning changes at Town Meeting
            2022. Consider a workshop to highlight ADUs as a means to support aging in place
            and provide an overview of planning considerations. See Housing Assistance
            Corporation of Cape Cod2 to learn about technical and financial supports that
            address obstacles to foster the creation of ADUs.
            o Expand funding opportunities for home modifications and repairs. Consider a
            fundraising event for Habitat for Humanity to support their critical home repair
            program. The program provides opportunities for residents in Norwell to apply for
            funding home modifications and volunteer contractor time.
            o Continue to host “housing choice” lunch and lecture series with local experts (e.g.,
            real estate agents, contractors, disability commission members, lawyers, financial
            professionals) to encourage pro-active thinking about aging in place and inform
            residents of local creative resources that support housing needs.

            8  Many Norwell residents need support due to physical or cognitive conditions, and
            many caregivers need help.
            o Forty percent of survey respondents stated that they currently, or have in the past
            two years, provided care or assistance to a person who was disabled or frail. That
            number is highest among those age 50-59 (52% reporting having provided care) and
            those in their 60s (44% reporting having provided care).
            o Among caregivers, 77% in their 50s and 75% in their 60s reported that it is
            challenging to provide care and complete their daily responsibilities.
            o Most are caring for persons with mobility challenges (56%), and 34% are caring for
            someone living with dementia.

            Recommendations:
            o Look at options to expand supports for caregivers and create new ways of providing
            information about referral resources available through the COA.
             Consider hosting a family caregiver “resource fair” as an opportunity to
            connect the Norwell COA with family caregivers.
             Consider developing a volunteer respite program, which would require space
            and staff oversight, to offer residents a few hours of respite.
             Explore ability to create an adult day program. Secure additional funding,
            potentially through the MBTA assessment reimbursement, to facilitate the
            expansion of existing transportation services provided by South Shore
            Community Action Council, to neighboring area social day programs.
             Consider launching a Momentia3 initiative among caregivers, individuals with
            dementia, and volunteers to foster social engagement and learning in a
            supportive environment.
             Host an educational series at the library where caregivers can share their
            experiences during lectures, webinars, and wellness events that offer
            strategies and tools to support their experience as caregivers. See Elderwise4
            and Alzheimer’s Association for free online learning and opportunities to
            explore in person workshops.5
            o Guided by the COA, continue to conduct community-wide dementia friendly training
            among Town Staff and residents Dementia training was recently conducted among
            first responders and the CERT team. The collaborative training experience with COA
            staff led to the creation of an exceptional needs registry; this tool will allow residents
            to self-identify with challenges that EMS should be aware of when responding to an
            emergency.

            9 o Similar to dementia friendly training, explore opportunities to establish Mental
            Health First Aid training. See Dementia Friends,6 a training initiative that raises
            awareness while expanding capacity to support residents through a train the trainer
            model.
            o Leverage Norwell’s S.A.F.E and Senior Safe programs to design intergenerational
            events which build awareness of safety challenges that affect residents of all ages,
            such as cyber security and fire safety. The programs bring trained firefighter
            educators and residents together to discuss fire and life safety lesson s.
            o Build volunteer support through a multigenerational approach7 or an informal
            arrangement8 for gardening programs, including dementia friendly, through the
            existing partnership with Donovan Farms. Off season, conduct flower arrangement
            or wreath making classes. Consider obtaining donations from local event venues or
            funeral homes that may have excess flowers.
            o Promote musical engagement. Leverage existing partnership with South Shore
            Conservatory to incorporate Creative Arts Therapies (CAT) such as Music Therapy,
            Dance Therapy, and accessible yoga for all ages and levels of ability. Potentially
            feature music therapy during a future memory café program that will be conducted
            with grant funding provided by South Shore Elder Services.

             Given its rural nature, the risk of social isolation is high in Norwell.
            o There are features of life in Norwell that can make it easy to lose touch or self-
            isolate—large property sizes, rural nature, lack of transportation and walkability, and
            periods of bad weather.
            o As well, some survey respondents report modifying their driving in some ways to
            maintain safety (26%) and a small share report not driving at all (4%). This includes
            15% of those respondents age 80 or older.
            o According to American Community Survey data, 18% of Norwell residents age 65 and
            older live alone (18%). Among survey respondents, this rate of living alone is highest
            among those in their 80s (35%).
            o 14% of survey respondents get together in-person with someone once a month or
            less.

            Recommendations:
            o Promote the COA’s telephone reassurance and friendly visitor programs through
            additional channels in Norwell (such as the Schools and Library) to reach more older
            residents and caregivers.

            10 o Explore opportunities to launch a Village in Norwell that will support growing needs
            related to companionship, transportation, and home maintenance supports. See
            Seaglass Village in Swampscott.9
            o Engage local faith communities10, restaurants, and nonprofits to host a monthly
            community dinner to provide a regular opportunity for residents to come together in
            a social setting.
            o Work together with the Public Works Department to install new, or dedicate existing,
            “Chat Benches11” to create public spaces where socializing is encouraged.
            o For residents with family out of Town, consider creating an “Adopt-a-grandparent12”
            program in which local residents can meet up with younger families and do things
            together like celebrate Grandparents Day with a luncheon or bake cookies for the
            holidays.
            Consider celebrating National Good Neighbor Day (9/28) or Older Americans Month
            (May) with a series of “Let’s Talk, Norwell” programs13 in which residents come
            together to be in conversation with one another that are exhilarating, inspiring, and
            meaningful.

            11 Introduction
            Over the coming years, the population of older adults in Norwell will continue to be a large
            share of the population as residents contemplate their choice to age in Norwell. Currently,
            many older adults benefit from programs and services designed to address aging-related
            needs and prolong independence, offered through the Norwell Council on Aging and the
            Norwell Senior Center. As a municipal entity, Norwell’s Senior Center is an important and
            valued resource, operating as the Town’s central point of contact for older residents who
            seek services to promote healthful and fulfilling lives. Growth of the older adult population
            therefore has special significance for the Senior Center and increasing demand for its
            services and programs can be expected moving forward.

            This report presents results of a comprehensive examination of issues relating to aging in
            Norwell. A need assessment was undertaken to support planning efforts of the Norwell
            Council on Aging (COA) and the community as a whole. Results presented here focus on the
            characteristics and needs of Norwell residents who are age 50 and older, considering their
            needs and preferences both now and in the future. While the primary goal of this report is to
            support planning on the part of the COA, a secondary goal is to present information that will
            be useful to other Norwell offices and organizations interacting with older residents.

            The Norwell Council on Aging and Senior Center

            In Massachusetts, Councils on Aging (COAs) are municipally appointed agencies meant to
            link older residents to needed resources. Virtually every city and town in Massachusetts has
            a COA, and in most communities, they serve as the only public social service agency. Each
            COA is expected to establish its own priorities based on local needs and resources. Many
            COAs are responsible for operating a senior center, a community facility housing senior
            services and programs, along with the staff and volunteers offering them. The Norwell
            Council on Aging is tasked with providing information and some direct services to Norwell
            residents aged 60 and older. The COA has been in existence since 1966 and offers a wide
            variety of programs and support services. The NCOA’s mission14 is to be a resource to the
            community and to offer programs and services in a safe, welcoming and open environment
            that fosters learning, social interaction, volunteerism and to enhance dignity and a
            connection to the community.

            14 https://www.townofnorwell.net/council-aging


            12 In general, when considering the mission of Councils on Aging, observers commonly think of
            two sets of responsibilities. First, COAs promote well-being among older residents by
            offering activities that appeal specifically to older adults and that promote personal growth
            and social engagement. Exercise classes, late-life learning programs, and informational
            programs are good examples. Second, COAs provide services to older residents and their
            families that promote physical and emotional wellness. Blood pressure clinics and
            transportation services are common examples of such services. Many observers are not
            aware of two additional important responsibilities of COAs. COA staff members link older
            residents in the community to existing programs for which they may be eligible by providing
            needed information and referring residents to appropriate programs and services. For
            example, staff may help residents apply for income support programs or health insurance
            made available through the state or federal government. Finally, COAs provide leadership
            within the community around issues faced
            by older adults, by serving on municipal
            boards, interacting with other municipal
            offices, and serving as resources to
            residents and organizations.

            The COA plays an important leadership
            role in the community, serving as a
            resource to other Town offices and
            organizations working in the community,
            and collaborating on initiatives broadly
            beneficial to residents. COA services and
            programs are funded by municipal
            appropriation, grant support from the
            Executive Office of Elder Affairs and other
            sources including gifts and donations, and
            nominal fees charged for some activities.
            The Norwell Council on Aging (NCOA) is a municipal department. It includes seven-member
            board of town-appointed residents. They advise the Norwell Senior Center as they provide
            multi-purpose programs, transportation, and outreach to the community. Staff of the Council
            on Aging includes one full-time Director, one part-time Community Services Coordinator,
            one full-time Program Coordinator, three part-time drivers and three on-call drivers, three
            part-time receptionists and 1 part-time custodian. COA staff actively look to partnerships
            with other Town departments, community organizations, and local businesses to build
            programming and resources in Norwell. The COA and high school partner each year to host
            a Senior-to-Senior day in September and also hold an annual book discussion. Together with Norwell

            13 the Recreation and Conservation departments, a walking group was created and nature walk
            and talk events are held. The COA also co-sponsors events with the library.
            The Norwell Senior Center operates Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. They
            offer an on-demand van transportation service that takes residents within Norwell and to
            surrounding towns to destinations like grocery stores, pharmacies, libraries, and shopping.
            Transportation to medical appointments is also available by appointment.
            In addition to dedicated staff, and the COA Board, the Senior Center is supported by the
            Friends of the Norwell Council on Aging (FNCOA), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, run by dedicated
            volunteers. The Senior Center is a better place because of the “Friends” volunteerism and
            generosity; and their funds subsidize the programs offered by the NCOA and supplement
            other financial needs of the organization.
            The Norwell Senior Center celebrated its 40th birthday in 2022 and marked the occasion with
            a public celebration. The day included a display of old photos and scrapbooks on loan from
            the Historical Society. Sen. Patrick O’Connor and Rep. David DeCoste presented
            proclamations recognizing the event. Visitors included members of the COA Board, Friends,
            Fire and Police personnel, Select Board members, Town Administrator and many residents.
            During 2022, the Norwell Senior Center continued to be a site for COVID-19 vaccinations and
            distributed COVID test kits to residents. The COA also launched their Dementia Friendly
            initiative with a five-part community education series. With support from the Dementia
            Friends Action team and partnerships with the Alzheimer’s Association, local memory care
            facilities, and home care providers, additional dementia friendly programming is being
            developed. As well, the Norwell COA was selected as a case study for an MCOA Small & Rural
            conference presentation on Understanding the Physical Infrastructure of a Dementia
            Friendly Community. The presentation highlighted the use of universal design with dementia
            friendly components to improve built space for those living with dementia. Norwell was
            recognized for best practices that included the use of contrasting colors and ensuring that
            surroundings feel home like or familiar. Norwell’s Senior Center will be included in future
            presentations to architectural groups. Social events, lifelong learning courses, and exercise
            programs are among the most popular programs that the NCOA offers---despite their
            physical limitation of accommodating no more than 50 people in the current space.
             7,027 social service or outreach interactions (remote/in-person) were conducted
            with seniors and/or their family members connecting them with needed supports
            and information about aging in the community.
             6, 676 meals were delivered to residents in their homes. As well, 1,612 meals were
            distributed via on-site meals at the NCOA or via a “grab and go” option.


            14  2,040 round trip rides were provided to medical appointments, hospitals, grocery,
            and drug stores.
             Residents participated 1,374 times in a recreational or educational program at the
            NCOA.
             Residents participated 1,092 times in fitness activities at the NCOA.
             Residents under age 60 were helped by the NCOA over 500 times with requests
            related to information and referral, programming, and transportation.
            Methods
            Methods used in compiling this report include analysis of existing data. Demographic
            material used in this report was drawn from the U.S. Census Bureau (the decennial censuses
            and the American Community Survey), from projections generated by the Donahue Institute
            at the University of Massachusetts, and from the Healthy Aging Data Report for Norwell
            (Massachusetts Healthy Aging Collaborative, n.d.). Additional information about the Norwell
            COA was retrieved from material drawn from the COA’s 2021 Annual Report as well as
            original data collected for this study.
            Demographic Profile
            As an initial step toward understanding characteristics of the Town of Norwell’s older
            population through quantitative data, we generated a demographic profile of the Town using
            data from the decennial U.S. Census and the American Community Survey (ACS)—a large,
            annual survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. For purposes of this assessment, we
            primarily used information drawn from the most current 5-year ACS files (2017-2021),
            along with U.S. Census data for the Town of Norwell to summarize demographic
            characteristics including growth of the older population, shifts in the age distribution,
            gender, race and education distributions, householder status, living arrangements,
            household income, and disability status.
            Key Informant Interviews
            In the Fall of 2022, we conducted interviews with seven individuals who currently hold
            leadership positions in Norwell. We spoke with the Recreation Superintendent, the Chiefs of
            Police and Fire, the Town Administrator, the Director of Planning and Community
            Development, a select board member, and the Assistant Town Manager and Finance Director.
            Interviews focused on the interviewees’ perceptions relating to unmet, as well as foreseeable
            community needs; and potential solutions that promote aging in place and wellness among
            residents. All interviews were conducted remotely via telephone or video conference.
            Interviews ranged from 35-90 minutes.


            15 Focus Groups
            During the Fall of 2022, we conducted three focus groups with residents and stakeholders
            who were recruited by the Director of the COA, with input from the COA board of directors.
            Two groups of residents were convened. One group was comprised of “current seniors” in
            Norwell (n=14). A second group of residents was comprised of “rising seniors” (n=9).
            Caregivers were represented in both groups. A third focus group was made up of municipal
            staff and community stakeholders (n=12). This group included representatives from local
            housing sites, long-term care facilities, Veteran’s services, and local nonprofits. The current
            seniors and community stakeholder focus groups were held at the NCOA and the focus group
            of “rising seniors” was held via ZOOM.
            Community Survey
            In collaboration with the COA Board members, a community survey was developed for this
            study and mailed to all residents aged 50 and over (N=4,378). A mailing list was obtained
            from the Norwell Town Clerk, based on the most current municipal census. Postcards were
            mailed to participants alerting them that they would be receiving a survey in the coming
            weeks. Subsequently, printed surveys were mailed to Norwell residents meeting the age
            requirement, along with a postage-paid return envelope. As well, the survey was made
            available via the Town’s website. A total of 1,081 responses to the survey were obtained,
            representing a strong return rate of 25% (see Table 2). Twelve percent (n=130) were
            returned online, and the rest of the responses were returned by mail.

            Data Analysis
            Data collected for the resident survey were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics,
            including frequencies and cross-tabulations, and are reported in full in tables contained in
            Appendix A and throughout the results section of this report. Some responses elicited
            through open-ended questions were extracted and cited verbatim within this report (e.g.,
            “What are your greatest concerns about your ability to continue living in Norwell?"). Notes
            taken during the study’s qualitative components (e.g., focus groups, key informant
            interviews) were reviewed by project staff and used to characterize and categorize salient
            ways in which aging issues are impacting older adults and individuals who work with older
            adults in Norwell. We used information from all sources of data to develop recommendations
            reported in the final section of this report.

            residents living in the Town of Norwell in 2021. About 35% of the population (3,818)
            individuals) were age 50 and older (See Table 1). Residents who were age 50 to 59 (1,745)
            individuals) made up 16% of the population; residents age 60 to 79 (1,655 individuals)
            comprised around 15%, and another 418 residents (4%) were age 80 and older.

            The share of Norwell’s population age 50 and older is slightly smaller than the overall state
            of Massachusetts ( Figure 1 ). About 38% of the Massachusetts population was in the 50+ age
            group in 2021, compared to 35% of the Norwell population. The share of Norwell residents
            age 60 and over is close to 20% less than the state of Massachusetts as a whole and the share
            of Norwell residents age 80 and over is the same as the estimated amount for the state as a
            whole. In 2021, Massachusetts residents age 60 and over comprised about 24% of the
            population, including 4% age 80 and over. In Norwell, about 19% of the population was age
            60 or older, including 4% who were 80 years or older.

            As shown in Figure 2 , between 2010 and 2021, it is estimated that the growth of the Norwell
            population grew by 7%. Estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau show that in 2021, there
            were 2,073 residents age 60 or older living in Norwell—comprising 19% of the total
            population. Local census numbers from 2022 indicate that 2,792 of Norwell residents (25%)
            is age 60 or older. Projections suggest that by 2030, nearly 33% of Norwell will be age 60 or
            older, suggesting that the community is on its way towards this increasing older adult
            population.

            Socio-Demographic Characteristics of Norwell’s Older Population
            Norwell is less diverse than the state with respect to race. For all ages combined, about 93%
            of Norwell residents report their race as White non-Hispanic, compared to 71% in
            Massachusetts ( ACS, 2017-2021, Table B01001 ). Among older adults, Norwell is less diverse.
            The majority of older residents (96%) report White race and ethnicity.
            The remaining percentage of the population age 65 and older reported 2 or more races (2%),
            Hispanic or Latino race/ethnicity 2%, Asian race/ethnicity (1%), and less than (<1%) report Black or
                Hawaiian/Pacific Islander race/ ethnicity. Additionally, almost 3% of older Norwell residents speak a
                language other than English at home (ACS, 2017-2021, Table B16004 ). Those who speak another language
                other than English at home most commonly speak an Indo-European language (2%) and (<1%) report speaking
                Spanish or an Asian or Pacific language at home. American Community Survey estimates on education
                suggest that Norwell residents are well educated on average. About 42% of persons 65 and older have
                either a bachelor’s degree 6,4677,4406,7916,3311,6651,745 1,664 1,3311,8661,6552,258 2,722508 418

                graduate/professional (15%); ACS, 2017-2021, Table B15001 ). This educational profile contributes to the
                vitality and character of the community, which depends on older adults who value opportunities to be
                involved through volunteer and civic engagement activities, as well as late-life learning opportunities—
                activities that are often present in highly educated communities. Similar to older adults living in
                communities throughout the U.S., a large proportion of Norwell residents aged 65 and over remain in the
                workforce. More than 28% of adults age 64 to 74 are participating in the labor force. Of those age 75
                and older, nearly 9% remain in the workforce ( ACS, 2017–2021, Table S2301). Nearly 18% of residents age
                65 and older report veteran status ( ACS, 2017–2021, Table B21001). As a result, many of the Town’s
                older residents may be eligible to receive some benefits and program services based on their military
                service or that of their spouses. Senior Center staff work closely with the Veteran Service Officer of
                Norwell to assist veterans, their dependents, and survivors with benefits and other resources. Living
                arrangements and housing costs of Norwell’s Older Population A majority of Norwell’s 3,567 households
                have householders who are middle-aged or older. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a “householder” is
                the person reported as the head of household, typically the person in whose name the home is owned or
                rented. In fact, about of 70% of all households in Norwell are headed by someone age 45 or older,
                including 23% of those who are age 65 and over ( Figure 3 .) Younger than age 45,… Age 45 to 64, 47%Age

                2017-2021`, Table B25007. Numbers are calculated from 5-year survey estimates. Most Norwell residents
                live in homes that they own or are purchasing (91%; Figure 4 ). Nearly 92% of residents age 45 to 64 own
                their homes, and 87% of householders 65 and older own their homes. A sizeable share of Norwell residents
                who are 65 and older and live alone, also own their home (71%). The much higher number of older
                homeowners has implications for what amenities and services are likely to be needed and valued by
                members of the community. Home maintenance and supports are often necessary for older
                homeowners—especially those who live alone—in order to maintain comfort and safety in their homes.
                Source: American Community Survey, 2017-2021, Tables B25007 and B25011. Numbers are calculated from
                5-year survey estimates. Additionally, 35% of Norwell’s 3,567 households have at least one individual
                who is age 60 or older ( ACS 2017-2021), Table B11006) . This high proportion— which is likely to
                increase in the future— generally reflects the widespread demand for programs, services, and other 91%

                home environments. Among the 3,720 housing structures in Norwell ( Figure 5 ), 93% are single unit
                structures, close to 5% are housing structures that contain more than 2 housing units and the remaining
                2% are mobile homes. Source: American Community Survey, 2017-2021, Table B25024. Numbers are calculated
                from 5-year survey estimates. A large proportion of Norwell residents who are age 65 and older (18%)
                live alone in their household whereas 72% live in households that include other people, such as a
                spouse, parents, children, or grandchildren ( Figure 6 ). Additionally, 10% of Norwell residents live

                from 5-year survey estimates. With respect to household income, Norwell residents’ median household
                income is higher than the one estimated for Massachusetts as a whole, $172,022 compared to $89,026.
                Among Norwell’s householders those aged 45-64 have the highest median income at $215,737—which is also
                more than the statewide median for this age group ($109,641). Among householders 65 and older, the
                median income is $89,107, higher than the statewide median for this age group ($56,483), but lower than
                the median income of younger Norwell householders. Older residents living alone are at the greatest
                disadvantage in terms of household income. Given that close to 18% of residents age 65 and older live
                alone in Norwell, these figures suggest that a sizeable number of residents are at risk of economic
                insecurity. The economic profile of older Norwell residents relative to younger residents is further
                illustrated in Figure 7 , which shows that the older adult population lives on a modest income. It is
                estimated that 44% of Norwell residents age 65 and older report incomes of $100,000 or more. By
                comparison, 80% of households headed by younger residents report this level of income. Nevertheless, a
                share of households headed by someone age 65 and older (16%) report annual incomes under $25,000. This
                compares with 2% of households headed by individuals age 45 to 64 having incomes under $25,000. Thus,
                there is a sizeable segment of Norwell’s older population that is at risk of financial insecurity or
                economic disadvantage. Lives with others 72%Lives alone 18% Lives in group quarters 10%Figure 6 . Living

                older householders. Estimates indicate that 36% of householders age 65 and overspend 35% of their
                monthly household income on housing costs (ACS 2017-2021, Table B25093). Source: Source: American

                Includes only community households, not group quarters such as nursing homes. The increased likelihood
                of acquiring a disability with age is evident in data from the ACS. 28% of Norwell residents age 65 and
                older experience some level of disability that could impact their ability to function independently in
                the community. About 12% of Norwell’s residents age 65 and older have one disability, and nearly 16%
                report two or more disabilities ( Figure 8 ). Among the different types of disability that are assessed
                in ACS, the most commonly cited by older Norwell residents 65 and older were ambulatory (17%), hearing
                difficulties (15%), and independent living difficulties (15%) ( ACS 2017–2021, Table S1810). Other
                disabilities experienced by older Norwell residents include cognitive difficulty (6%), self-care

                desirable features to residents of all ages, from its rural setting and idyllic outdoor spaces to the
                services and resources provided by the Town. These features contribute to the desire among longtime and
                new residents to build continuity and age in the community. Key informant discussions reflected their
                work experiences and meaningful interaction with older residents, many of whom were described as highly
                effective in advocating for themselves and harmonizing with other agencies and departments. Key
                Informants also acknowledged the importance of Norwell’s Dementia Friendly planning initiative which
                responds to the increasing prevalence of dementia, and other health challenges associated with aging.
                During the key informant interviews, Town leaders stressed the need to focus on prominent issues related
                to aging including economic insecurity, housing, community supports, transportation, and opportunities
                for community engagement. Anticipation and recognition of needs are evident in Town planning initiatives
                that seek to leverage the Town’s strengths to create an environment that is supportive and engaging for
                all ages. Outlets for community engagement are already constrained by demand. The Council on Aging’s
                comprehensive range of programs and services has evolved over the years from a drop-in center to a
                multifaceted organization supporting older adults and caregivers. During the pandemic, recognition of
                the COA’s valuable impact and capacity to support the community, in person and remotely, grew
                significantly. Despite its value, Town leaders are aware that the Senior Center’s existing space is
                inadequate and limits the scope of operations. In addition to limited physical capacity, the COA’s reach
                is impacted by the perception among a number of residents that the COA’s offerings are not aligned with
                their interests and needs, particularly those of the younger senior demographic. Key Informants
                acknowledged that the needs and preferences of residents aging in Norwell are changing and are
                various---suggesting that the current COA space is not a sufficient outlet for community members to
                gather and continue their pursuit of healthy aging. Key informants acknowledged that the community has
                not only outgrown existing COA space but also acknowledged that the Recreation Department is
                experiencing similar space constraints. The Recreation Department has close to 5,500 registered program
                participants. While over 2,000 registrants are enrolled in summer youth programming, the interests and
                needs of older adults are considered in program design and there is a recognized needed to reach a
                broader portion of the population over age 50. Adult programs include yoga, meditation, basketball,
                volleyball, pickleball, painting, photography, and jewelry making. The high number of recreation visits
                at multiple makeshift sites in town suggests an opportunity to bring the community together for multiple
                offerings in one accessible location. 26 Together, the challenges, and goals of the COA and Recreation
                departments suggest a strong opportunity to build a shared facility with innovative features and
                increased capacity in a central location. Collaborative planning efforts are underway to create a
                Community Center, where programs and services would be offered to the entire community of Norwell. With
                a strong presence of longtime residents and young families, this model offers an opportunity to build
                community enhancing intergenerational engagement while also designating space related to the interests
                and needs of older adults. Key informants expressed that there is a sense of synergy and willingness
                among generations that will contribute to the support and success of Norwell’s initiative to build a
                Community Center. Cost of property taxes combined with limited downsizing options is forcing some
                residents to leave Norwell. Affordability---related to rising costs of living and property taxes-- was
                woven throughout the key informant discussions as a significant concern in Norwell. The tax rate is one
                of the highest in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the commercial tax base is small. For retired
                residents and those living on a fixed income, the burden of paying for health care and housing can
                impact quality of life. The town is exploring tax relief programs and building efforts to inform
                residents of exemption and abatement opportunities. At 2022 Town Meeting, an article passed to create a
                local senior circuit breaker abatement. The Town of Norwell offers a 10% discount on water utility costs
                for eligible residents over age 60 and an overlay account is maintained to offset real estate and motor
                vehicle exemptions. The tax work program is successful and provides an opportunity for residents to
                share their experience with the community in return for up to a $1,500 reduction on their property
                taxes. With limited options for downsizing, the ability to remain in the community where they are
                rooted, have contributed, and envision their future becomes a challenge. Inventory consists
                predominantly of single-family homes, many of which reside on large lots, and were built before 1950.
                These features are often associated with expensive maintenance and modifications that allow residents to
                safely remain in their homes. Through grant funding and donations, the COA is addressing related needs
                through funding and pro bono work for eligible residents. There is limited rental housing, no assisted
                living facility, one 55+ community, a housing property on River Street, and one memory café facility.
                The housing crisis was characterized as dramatic due to an enormous shortfall of housing created in the
                last decade due to the economy, construction costs, and pandemic disruptions. With a growing population
                of older adults there will be a need for an accompanying increase in housing options that are
                affordable, supportive, and accessible. Conversations around the need to diversify inventory have
                continued for years in Norwell. Resistance to change is a barrier to the development of 27 housing and
                has limited proposals for additional senior and affordable options in the past. Key informants shared
                related planning and zoning efforts underway. To support aging in place, an article was approved at 2022
                Town Meeting allowing homeowners to create accessory dwelling units (ADUs) by right, provided
                eligibility requirements are met. Additionally, the use of a village residential overlay district with a
                density bonus is being explored to expand 55+ housing inventory. Community based supports are a crucial
                tool in helping residents age in place. The COA provides a range of health-related supports and
                transportation to healthcare providers in neighboring towns. As well, the COA offers classes to
                encourage residents to age well. However, as people age, they are more likely to develop health
                conditions or a disability that limits their ability to participate in the community. Key informants
                described ways that the community is supporting some of these more vulnerable households and emphasized
                that continued outreach and awareness is needed to ensure that residents can be supported before crises
                arise. For example, proactive outreach is coordinated among the COA, CERT (Community Emergence Response
                Team), Board of Health, Police and Fire. These departments have conducted training, including dementia
                friendly, to respond to needs and health conditions of older residents. Additionally, there are
                collaborative efforts to increase public education, conduct home safety evaluations, and leverage
                several tools including: Commuter Aided Dispatch and the Vial for Life program. These programs support
                the management of data that has been shared by residents and contribute to their care. Key informants
                also shared that the caregiver support network is fragile, especially overnight. Challenges are expected
                to grow in the coming years, prompting the need to identify resources for a sustainable caregiver
                support network. In response to projected needs related to the increasing prevalence of dementia, a
                volunteer team is being assembled to support Norwell’s Dementia Friendly initiative. The initiative’s
                goal is to ensure that the community is sophisticated in its response and provision of services for the
                growing population impacted by dementia. Accessing the community via transportation options or walking
                is very limited— keeping Norwell a car dependent community. There is no public transportation in
                Norwell. Transportation services are available through the COA and demand for services is generally met.
                The Town has enhanced its ability to meet needs through additional drivers and grant funding for
                vehicles; however, there is a need to increase access for on demand services during flexible timeframes,
                including evenings and weekends. Key informants acknowledged there are likely many residents who are
                unaware of available transportation options or who are unlikely to utilize transportation options due to
                stigma or pride. Expansion of transportation options would offer flexibility, affordability, and foster
                independence for residents who are no longer driving and at risk of becoming isolated. MBTA access does
                not exist in Norwell but an action plan has been submitted to be 28 recognized as an adjacent MBTA
                district, which will contribute to housing and transit- oriented development. Norwell is challenged by
                the limited network of sidewalks and lack of walkability to basic amenities. Opportunities for residents
                to engage in exercise, feel connected to their neighbors, and to safely access the community in which
                they live are restricted. Norwell’s Traffic Committee communicates challenges with decision makers and
                seeks grant funding for projects to enhance existing infrastructure. Through participation in the
                Massachusetts DOT Complete Streets program, the Town is addressing improvements to increase
                accessibility, safety, and walkability through the prioritization of sidewalk enhancements and new
                construction. As sidewalk expansion occurs, efforts will be made to build walkable connections to
                Norwell’s extensive trail network. Communication about what is available, and for whom, is an ongoing
                challenge. While efforts are made among departments to coordinate community outreach, there is an
                opportunity for the Town to evaluate and improve existing channels to ensure residents are aware of
                services, and how to access them. The COA shares comprehensive information via their newsletter and
                website; other department channels, and Norwell Spotlight TV. Feedback from the Needs Assessment
                suggests that there are awareness gaps related to existing services including financial counseling that
                informs residents of available tax relief programs and tools such as a reverse mortgage. For older
                adults, technology barriers can increase the risk of missing valuable communication from the Town. The
                COA offers equipment and Wi-Fi support through an iPad loaner program, which is grant fund by the
                Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act and Massachusetts Executive office of elder
                affairs. Key informants stressed the need to communicate through multiple channels, including paper
                based, and continue to inform residents of technology support programs currently provided by the COA.
                Results from Focus Groups Themes from the three focus groups were synthesized and are described in this
                section. Many of the issues overlap with the issues identified by key-informants; but the perspective on
                the issues among residents is more nuanced. Focus group participants widely characterized Norwell as a
                safe community with a beautiful landscape and access to many outdoor recreation opportunities, including
                pathways that are accessible for all ages and abilities. Participants value Norwell’s location, which
                offers convenient access to Boston and proximity to several amenities including hospitals, healthcare
                providers, shopping, and restaurants. A strong sense of community is heightened by the presence of many
                longtime residents and the network of faith organizations. Social connections are valued, and these
                relationships contribute to the desire to stay in Norwell 29 and contribute to the community. Town
                Departments were recognized for the range of services provided to residents; the Council on Aging was
                specifically mentioned as an asset for older adults while the school system was recognized as a strength
                for families in Norwell. The new Library offers a range of programs to meet diverse interests in the
                community. Together, the strengths shared by participants contribute to the strong appeal of living in
                Norwell and in turn to strong levels of housing appreciation. While this itself is seen as a strength,
                it simultaneously contributes to a significant challenge that was shared by focus group participants,
                affordability. Focus group participants recognized that Town leaders are responding to this challenge
                through property related tax supports that reduce cost burdens associated with rising property values.
                While Norwell’s strengths, years of friendships, and opportunities to volunteer in the community are
                valued, they must increasingly be weighed against future concerns related to affordability and other
                challenges, which are described below. Challenges Affordability and personal struggles are not always
                visible. Focus group participants echoed the concerns shared throughout the key informant interviews
                related to affordability. With limited commercial activity in Norwell, the resident tax base has
                historically been high compared to neighboring communities. The impact of existing tax relief programs
                is limited by eligibility restrictions, pride, and lack of awareness. There is an opportunity to connect
                more residents to Norwell’s Community Preservation Committee (CPC) tax relief, tax deferment, and Senior
                Circuit Breaker programs. A circuit breaker resource flyer was recently distributed to the community to
                increase access to this underutilized resource. Costs related to housing and property maintenance often
                prompt a need to move away from Norwell, disrupting plans for residents who have lived in the community
                their entire lives. Members of the faith community shared that conversations with residents related to
                struggles include financial challenges, health concerns, and mental, emotional, spiritual changes
                occurring among older residents. At times, residents lack a local support network and pastoral care must
                extend to concerned out-of-state family members. These struggles prompt the need for meaningful support
                for residents who are navigating the loss of health, loss of home, and loss of their support networks.
                The Senior Center’s space is inadequate. Inadequate space limits opportunities to expand programming,
                which in turn lessens participation among residents who do not feel drawn, or a need, to explore
                offerings at the Senior Center. There is a segment of the population where residents are seeking
                engagement opportunities because they are no longer aligned with the school or yet aligned with the
                Senior Center. There is an opportunity to re-brand the COA and minimize the perception that 30 you need
                a need to participate – getting people there is the hardest part of building appreciation for the COA’s
                valued offerings. While it is difficult to increase programs in the existing space, creative solutions,
                including continued partnerships, are needed to offer programming that is appealing to a broader age
                group. Norwell’s rural infrastructure increases the risk of isolation . Limited opportunities for
                engagement relate to the mapping of Norwell’s housing stock, which includes homes that are set back from
                the road on sprawling lots; a limited number of walkable neighborhoods; and no public transit. Building
                opportunities for mobility and places to congregate are critical means to facilitate interaction among
                residents. For the inclusion of older adults, there is a need to re-frame the sense of community around
                seniors in a way that highlights shared interests and opportunities to create gathering spaces and
                activities for all ages. One participant shared the need to provide guidance for individuals living and
                aging alone and support for individuals and caregivers living with dementia. Another participant with a
                family member living with dementia expressed gratitude toward the Town of Norwell for efforts related to
                building dementia friendly training and features in the community. Housing options are limited;
                waitlists are long, and costs are high. Disparities exist related to housing availability and
                affordability as people age. There are limited options for downsizing in Norwell and a dire need to
                build diverse options to meet the needs and preferences of the community. With increasing property
                valuations, the property gap and associated financial benefits that once occurred while downsizing have
                shrunk over the years. Access to affordable housing in Norwell is hindered by current practices that
                require interaction at the state level. Improvements, where the state’s role will be minimized, are
                developing and will increasingly allow local housing authorities to connect residents with properties in
                Norwell, instead of forcing residents to relocate to other locations in the state. Efforts to develop
                additional 55+ housing have not been successful. With limited housing options there are implications:
                people stay in homes that are unsafe and do not meet their needs, or they uproot and leave town. A
                resident shared the hope that Norwell will be a visionary community in creating diverse options,
                including clusters of smaller homes, with access to supports and programming for residents to age in the
                community. Demands for home maintenance and modification services are unmet. In addition to housing
                inventory limitations, real estate professionals shared that inquiries related to home maintenance needs
                are frequent. This suggests that additional communication channels beyond strong efforts of the Council
                on Aging would be helpful in communicating resources including: Habitat for Humanity’s Critical Repairs
                Program, which provides opportunities for residents in Norwell to apply for funding home modifications
                and 31 volunteer contractor time; and The Community Preservation Committee’s Small Housing Grant. During
                a recent downsizing event at the library, seasonal yardwork and snow removal were identified as
                community needs. A suggestion to incentivize students or invite volunteers to be connected with
                properties that require help during these seasonal periods. There is a need for an expanded network of
                accessible and supportive transportation services. Norwell is a car dependent community; access to
                reliable on demand transportation is critical for residents who are no longer driving or restrict their
                driving. There is a need to address growing demands on the COA amidst budget constraints that impact
                staffing levels and the number of available vehicles. Transportation for medical needs is available;
                however, unique needs exist. Due to limited schedule availability among healthcare providers and
                Medicare coverage changes for home-based dialysis, access to treatment is challenging. Funding support
                is being sought to increase efficiency for patients who spend excessive time at dialysis due to lack of
                transportation. Additionally, the need for flexible transportation to places of worship and social
                events - movies, book clubs, library events, etc.- should be prioritized. Participants also cited
                parking limitations, traffic concerns, excessive speeds, and narrow winding roads as challenges that
                inhibit mobility. Access to Home Care is challenged by lack of awareness, staffing shortages and costs—
                family caregivers are shouldering this burden. Resident participants shared concerns related to
                accessing health and community-based supports, critical determinants of healthful aging in place.
                Barriers that inhibit accessibility include lack of awareness, navigation difficulties, and healthcare
                staffing shortages. For some, there is a disconnect between their needs and knowing where to turn.
                Others are aware of resources; however, they find application processes to be overwhelming. Forms for
                utilities, Social Security, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Veterans related benefits,
                MA Health, and Medicare are often complex. Also, residents may avoid reaching out and sharing
                vulnerability due to fear of consequences such as loss of independence. Stakeholders, including COA
                staff, South Shore Elder Services, and Norwell’s Veteran Service Officer are leading efforts to foster
                access to these resources. Home care costs have increased significantly in recent years and staffing
                shortages are dire. Norwell Visiting Nurse Association provides services covered through insurance;
                however, the coverage period is small and in-home programming is limited. The continuum of care that
                existed in the past is fractured. Many nursing homes in Massachusetts are on the verge of closing and
                average costs are estimated to be close to $12K per month. The caregiver network is fragile, and many
                individuals are overwhelmed. Caregivers often travel long distances across the state and more remote
                towns are less likely to have coverage. A resident, who is also a caregiver, shared that caregiving is a
                full-time role due to the complex process 32 of accessing resources; those without an advocate are at
                risk of being left behind. Continued collaboration, staffing increases, and outreach efforts among
                providers are essential to ensure that adequate resources are available and communicated to Norwell’s
                aging population in the coming years. Communication gaps and lack of awareness inhibit access to
                resources. Current communication channels include the COA’s monthly newsletter, Recreation Department’s
                quarterly newsletter, Town websites, and social media. The COA newsletter is currently mailed to
                approximately 1,425 residents; an additional 1,650 copies are printed and distributed throughout
                Norwell. The newsletter is also distributed via email and through social media. Town wide distribution
                is cost prohibitive. Distribution can be efficiently broadened by having the online copy shared by other
                departments such as Recreation and the Library. Additional paper copies and sign up for the newsletter
                could also be made available at local businesses and the post office. Being aware of and having the
                tools to navigate resources is a challenge that is intensified by barriers related to fear, pride, and
                technology, including poor Wi-Fi service in parts of Norwell. The COA offers valuable technology support
                for residents, but demand has the potential to exceed available support. There is a need for a diverse
                communication strategy that meets residents at multiple comfort levels and includes traditional phone
                and paper- based vehicles. Participants shared that additional technology support and a communication
                strategy that is not age segregated would broadly connect the community to resources. Additionally,
                challenges related to readability and accessibility of information resources exist. Participants shared
                that there is a need to improve the content of agendas and minutes shared by town committees, so
                residents are better informed without having to attend meetings. The content of the COA newsletter is
                highly valued; however, the formatting is dense, making it difficult to navigate. An annual COA resource
                directory (paper and online) was suggested to reduce monthly newsletter content and improve readability.
                33 Results from the Community Survey In this section we report key findings from each section of the
                survey. Tables illustrating results in detail are included in Appendix A. Respondents to the community
                survey included 1,081 individuals aged 50 and older, representing a response rate of 25% (see Table 2).
                This is a strong return rate and reflects interest among community residents. Compared to the age
                distribution of Norwell as a whole, we heard from fewer residents in their 50s and from more residents
                over age 7015. To facilitate comparison of younger and older segments of the population with respect to
                needs and interests, we often present results grouped into four age groups: age group 50-59, age group
                60-69, age 70-79, and age 80 or older. Table 2. Community Survey Respondents Number of Responses Age

                25% are 70-79, and 14% are age 80+ (Source: American Community Survey, 2017-2021, Table B01001. Numbers
                are calculated from 5-year survey estimates). 34 Community and Neighborhood Survey respondents included
                residents who have lived in Norwell for many years, as well as relative newcomers. Duration of residing
                in Norwell varies from 15% of respondents who have been in Town less than 10 years compared to 51% who
                have lived in Norwell for more than 30 years (see Figure 9 ). These individuals offer insight based on
                their years of experience of living in Norwell. It is also helpful, however, to hear from those who are
                new to Norwell. Interestingly, 19% of survey respondents age 80+ have been in Norwell for less than 10
                years (see Appendix A ). Survey data suggests more than two-thirds of respondents are committed to
                remaining in Norwell as they age (see Figure 10 ). 8%7% 14% 20%51% < 5 years 5-9 years 10-19 years 20-29
                years 30 years or moreFigure 9 . How long have you lived in Norwell?A commonly expressed goal of older
                adults is to remain living in their own homes for as long as possible. Aging in place implies remaining
                in familiar home and community settings, with supports as needed, as opposed to moving to institutional
                settings, such as nursing homes (Salomon, 2010). By aging in place, older adults can retain their
                independence, as well as maintain valued social relationships and engagement with the community. In
                turn, aging in place may promote wellness by supporting physical activities that reduce risk of chronic
                disease and by accommodating disabling conditions. 35 A majority of survey participants took the time to
                respond to the open-ended question, “What are your greatest concerns about your ability to continue
                living in Norwell?” Despite the high number of comments, they could readily be categorized into four key
                areas of concern: 1) cost of property taxes—and concern about being able to remain in their
                homes/community as a result; 2) costs of living more broadly; 3) ability to maintain current home due to
                lack of downsizing options; 4) maintaining health and quality of life. Table 3 summarizes these
                concerns, drawing on verbatim responses from the survey. 27%48%61%76% 41%32%30%18% 32%20%9%6% 0% 20% 40%

                Norwell is the cost of property taxes and living, it is important to note that 11% of survey respondents
                (about 105 people) do not believe they have the financial resources to meet their basic needs (see
                Figure 11 ). 8%9%10%15% 0%2%4%6%8%10%12%14%16%18%20% Age 50-59 Age 60-69 Age 70-79 Age 80+Figure 11.
                Percentage disagreeing with the statement, "I 
have financial resources to meet my daily needs..." 38 Housing and Living Situation To assess the “age-friendliness” of
                the housing stock in Norwell, respondents were asked if they currently had a bedroom and bathroom on the
                entry-level of their home—an important feature as occupants age and mobility (up and down stairs)
                becomes more challenging. Figure 12 shows that half do have this feature in their home (54%) and 46% do
                not have this feature—suggesting that home modifications or a residential move may be needed for these
                residents to age safely and well. The availability and affordability of housing that is suitable to meet
                the changing capacity of older people are key factors that influence the ability of residents to age in
                place, and to lead fulfilling and healthy lives into old age. Many people are attached to their current
                home, even if the “fit” between individual capacity and the home environment decreases. Homes may become
                too large for current needs or may become too expensive to maintain on a fixed income. Design features
                of homes, such as the number of stories and manageability of stairs, may challenge older residents’
                ability to remain living safely in their home. Home modifications, including installation of bathroom
                grab bars, railings on stairs, adequate lighting throughout the home, ramps, and/or first floor
                bathrooms, may support residents’ safety and facilitate aging in place. Programs that connect older
                homeowners with affordable assistance for maintaining and modifying their homes and their yards can help
                protect the value of investments, improve the neighborhoods in which older people live, and support safe
                living. The availability of affordable housing options, especially those with accommodating features,
                including assisted living, may allow residents who are no longer able to stay in their existing homes to
                remain in their community. 39 Most survey respondents own their current home. Among homeowners, 50%
                report not having a mortgage while 45% currently have a mortgage on their home—including 36% of those in
                their 70s and 22% of those in their 80s (see Appendix A ). Survey participants were asked the type of
                housing they would prefer if a change in health or physical ability required moving from their current
                residence. Responses varied greatly by age group (see Figure 13 ). Among the youngest respondents, the
                highest rated type of future housing is smaller single family homes (preferred by 60% of those in their
                50s; and 48% of those in their 60s). Condos or townhomes were preferred options for those in their 70s
                (39%) and assisted living was a preferred alternative for those in their 80s (41%).No, 46% Yes,

                majority of survey respondents live with a spouse or partner (76%), and 22% live with an adult child,
                including 14% of those in their 70s and 80s. 15% of respondents live alone, including 14% of those in
                their 70s and 35% of those in their 80s. Living alone has the potential to lead to social isolation and
                has implications for services that may be needed by the older segment of the Norwell population.
                Additionally, 13% of respondents reported living with another relative (e.g., children, grandchildren,
                or parents). This suggests that for a small percentage of Norwell’s older residents, significant
                childcare or other family responsibilities could play a role in their lives. Modifying one’s home (e.g.,
                installing railings or grab bars in showers) in response to changing needs and preferences can promote
                independence and quality of life. As well, making repairs to a home can ensure that safety and quality
                of life is enjoyed. While a majority of respondents do not need such modifications as this time, 43%
                report that modifications are needed (see Figure 14 ). Among them, 11% cannot afford to make these
                changes. Given the share that need such repairs and modifications and have the resources to implement
                them, suggestions for connecting residents with handy-person services or information about taking action
                are made. 30% 11% 2%57%Figure 14. Does your current residence need modifications or repairs to improve

                Survey results show that only 4% of respondents do not drive, although this number is significantly
                larger when looking at just those age 80 and older, as 15% of this older segment of the population do
                not drive (see Figure 15 ). 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% Age 50-59 Age 60-69 Age 70-79 Age

                driveTransportation is a basic need for people of all ages who desire to lead independent, meaningful,
                and socially engaged lives. For older adults specifically, limited transportation options can lead to
                challenges in socializing, attending appointments, and fully participating in their community. The vast
                majority of Americans rely primarily on private transportation to meet these needs, and most individuals
                drive their own automobiles well into old age. Due to difficulties with transportation, individuals with
                health conditions and disabilities that adversely affect their ability to drive safely may be unable to
                participate in activities they previously enjoyed and valued. Indeed, a national survey of people aged
                50 and older conducted by the AARP (2005) found that compared to older drivers, non-drivers reported
                lower quality of life, less involvement with other people, and more isolation. 43 More than one out of
                four respondents (26%) who do drive modify their driving to make it easier or safer. Modifications
                include avoiding driving at night, in rush hour, or during bad weather. Modifying driving habits promote
                safety, but may limit independence and participation, especially if other transportation options are
                inaccessible, costly, or inconvenient. For example, older adults who avoid driving at night will
                struggle to participate in evening community meetings and programs. Those who avoid driving in bad
                weather may become isolated during the winter months. Transportation barriers can limit a person’s
                access to obtaining necessary services such as medical care. Respondents were asked if within the
                previous 12 months they had missed, cancelled, or rescheduled a medical appointment because of a lack of
                transportation. Among all respondents, only 4% reported this experience, and even among those who drive
                with modification, 7% indicated that this had occurred (see Figure 16 ). However, 31% of respondents who
                don’t drive missed, cancelled, or rescheduled a medical appointment within the past year. These findings
                suggest that transportation limitations appear to negatively impact accessing medical care for the most
                vulnerable segments of Norwell’s older resident community. 31% 7% 1% 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45%50% Non

                half (54%) of survey respondents reported needing help with activities around the house. Figure 17 shows
                that the most common types of help needed is with snow removal (35%), yard work (31%), small repairs
                (21%), and technology support (14%. Small numbers of residents need help with personal care (1%) or
                daily living tasks (3%). Overall, the trend is that older respondents report needing help at higher
                rates (see Appendix A ). Respondents were asked who would assist them around the house when they need
                help (see Appendix A ). More than two-thirds (65%) of respondents reported that a family member would
                help and 58% reported that they would pay someone to help. Smaller shares would have a friend (23%), or
                neighbor (18%) help them and 6% (n=72) report not knowing who would help them around the house when they
                needed it (see Appendix A ). Physical ability to engage in one’s environment is key component to aging
                well in the community. With age can come different and new health needs and preferences. Having access
                to opportunities to engage in health promoting activity and seek medical and mental health care is
                crucial to keeping residents living active, meaningful, and independent lives. Nationally, most of the
                care and support received by older adults due to health difficulties or disability is provided
                informally by family members or friends. Informal caregivers throughout the country contribute millions
                of hours of care without financial compensation. 45 Being able to access the community to access basic
                amenities or social activities is a crucial factor shaping healthy aging. For 86 survey respondents, 33
                of which are in their 80s, this is limited by an impairment of some kind (see Appendix A ). Another
                challenge for families and older adults is substance misuse. According to survey respondents, 28% have
                been individually affected by substance misuse ( Figure 18 ). These rates are highest among those in
                their 50s (38%) and 60s (33%). This substantial proportion signals the need for additional attention to
                be paid to the challenges that face older residents and their families. 35%31% 21% 14% 4% 3% 1%

                provided care or assistance to a person who was disabled or frail (see Appendix A). As shown in Figure
                19 , the rate of caregiving is highest among those age 50-59 (52% reporting having provided care) and
                those in their 60s (44% reporting having provided care). Notably, 34% of respondents over age 80 have
                reported recent caregiving experience. 52% 44% 32% 34% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60% 50-59 60-69 70-79 80+Figure

                care or assistance to someone within the past two years stated that it was very or somewhat challenging
                to provide this care and meet other family and/or work responsibilities. This was especially true for
                those age 50-59, where 77% of those providing care reported this was very or somewhat challenging and
                among those in their 60s as 75% report this was very or somewhat challenging for them (see Figure 20 ).
                Many in this age group are likely still working and therefore may be struggling to meet the demands of
                both caregiving and work. Even for the other age groups, more than half of those who provide care find
                it very or somewhat challenging. Services (e.g., transportation to adult day programs) and programming
                (e.g., support groups) might be needed to support caregivers. Caregivers were asked to indicate which
                conditions were experienced by their care recipient; the most frequently marked condition was mobility
                impairment (such as difficulty walking or climbing stairs) (56%; see Figure 21 ), while 34% of the
                people the survey respondents cared for were living with Alzheimer’s or dementia. Many respondents
                checked multiple responses to this question, indicating that their care recipient had more than one
                disability. At the community level, it is estimated that 13% of residents age 65 or older have been
                diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia ( Massachusetts Healthy Aging Collaborative Community
                Profiles ). 44%31%31%16% 33%44%35%32% 16%17%18%32% 7%8%16%20% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%Age 50-59Age

                Dementia Friendly community, survey respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with the
                following statement, “Norwell has adequate resources to support residents living with dementia and their
                families.” Figure 22 shows that 60% of respondents disagree or strongly disagree with this statement.
                This finding both supports the Towns current pursuits but also indicates that there is more to be done
                when it comes to supporting persons with dementia and those who love them. 6%19%20%29%30%34%56% 0% 10%

                continue to work beyond the traditional retirement age of 65, and this is evident in Norwell. Figure 23
                shows 73% of respondents in their 50s and 37% of those in their 60s are working fulltime. These results
                suggest that a large share of survey respondents may have time to pursue personal interests and
                activities. Interestingly, 14% of those in their 70s and 18% of those in their 80s report “looking for
                work” suggesting an opportunity to engage older residents in connecting with appropriately flexible job
                opportunities. 73% 8% 3% 2% 7% 5%37% 15% 9% 5%35% 6% 6%14%14% 6%67% 3% 1% 6%18% 1%74% 4%

                decision that shapes later life for most older people. For those still working, their experiences can
                mean less hours, different schedules, and an interest in maintaining professional relationships. For
                those who have chosen retirement, maintaining active lifestyles and contributing to the world around
                them can be important factors when considering how to spend their time. Regardless of employment status,
                the ability to pay for necessary expenses and maintain quality of life can be challenging due to age-
                related shifts in health, ability, costs, and streams of income. 50 For those who responded they are
                still working, more than half of those in their 60s and 40% of those in their 70s report plans to retire
                within the next 3-5 years. (see Figure 24 ). Thus, the Norwell Senior Center could experience an
                increase in attendance, which has implications for the capacity of senior center. Interestingly, many
                older adults who are still working do not know when they expect to retire. For example, 53% of those in
                their 70s who are still working report not knowing when they will retire or predict not being able to
                ever fully retire. Implementing evening and weekend programming might be one way to engage older workers
                with the Norwell Senior Center. Additionally, developing new programs that would particularly attract
                older workers would be useful. For example, convening a job fair for part-time or volunteer positions or
                hosting seminars on retirement planning—both financial and social. 8%54% 40%38% 32% 16% 0% 0%37% 2% 2%

                The majority of survey respondents speak with someone or use email or social media on at least a weekly
                basis to connect with family, friends, or neighbors (see Figure 25 ). Although 64% of the respondents
                get together in person with someone at least weekly, more than one- third only get together monthly or
                less frequently. Individuals who have infrequent contact with friends or relatives represent important
                groups to target for efforts aimed at reducing isolation and, more generally, improving emotional
                wellbeing. 84% 12% 4%87% 7% 15%64% 28% 8% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% Daily/weekly Monthly

                activities and relationships shape well -being for individuals of all ages. Indeed, the absence of
                social relationships may have as substantial a negative impact on health behaviors such as smoking or
                overeating. Many older adults are at high risk for social isolation, especially if their health and
                social networks break down. These risks are exacerbated if accessible services and transportation are
                not readily available to them as a means for maintaining contact with the world outside their homes.
                Providing opportunities for social engagement and participation in community events—through volunteer
                programs, learning opportunities and exercise programs, as well as social activities—can help community
                members maintain social support, remain active, prolong independence, and improve quality of life. 52 As
                shown in Figure 26 , survey respondents reported that when they spend time socializing ---it is most
                commonly done at restaurants or cafes, at a friend’s home, or in parks or outdoor spaces. Overall, small
                portions of survey respondents reported experiencing exclusion or discrimination in Norwell (see
                Appendix A ). For example, 12% of those in their 50s report feeling excluded because of their income and
                5% of those in their 70s report having been excluded because of their age. Overall, 8% of respondents
                selected an “other” reason and wrote in their experiences. Mostly commonly reported reasons for feeling
                excluded or discriminated against included political views, appearance, and overall sense of being
                excluded in Norwell for not being a lifetime resident or having children in the schools—in other words,
                respondents used words like “cliques” and “not very welcoming”. While only reported by a small number of
                respondents, it is a serious matter to consider. Respondents were asked if they knew someone living
                within a 1-hour travel distance on whom they could rely for help if needed (see Appendix A ). Only 8%
                reported not having someone like this in their life, with slightly higher rates among those in their 50s
                (10%) (see Appendix A ). For those without social support providers in close proximity, the Norwell COA
                can be a crucial resource. 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%Figure 26. Outside of your home, where do

                (75%) of survey respondents report that the Norwell Senior Center plays a role in their lives or the
                lives of their loved ones, neighbors, or friends—making it clear that the Norwell Senior Center is a
                revered community asset for many (see Appendix A ). Survey results suggest that participation in the
                Norwell Senior Center is considerably more common among older residents. As shown in Figure 27 , just 8%
                of those age 50-59 and report ever using programs or services offered by the Norwell COA, while 62% of
                the respondents age 80 and older indicated they have participated in the Norwell Senior Center. This
                age-graded pattern of participation is not unusual in senior centers and may reflect the increasing
                value of the Norwell Senior Center to older residents. 8%30%45%62% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70% Age 50-59 Age

                play a part in helping older adults age in place and in community. Residents may obtain transportation,
                health screening, or social services through their local COA. Older adults may seek opportunities for
                engagement and socialization through volunteer programs, learning opportunities and exercise programs,
                as well as social activities. There are approximately sixty volunteers supporting the Senior Center in a
                variety of roles including meal delivery, assembling the newsletter, and supporting trips and programs.
                These involvements can help community members maintain social support, remain active, prolong
                independence, and improve quality of life. Some research suggests that participating in a Senior Center
                may reduce one’s 54 Of those who do use the Norwell COA, 63% only visit the Center a few times a year,
                while 19% of COA users participate at least weekly ( Figure 28 ). This range of participation levels
                highlights the broad continuum of affiliation with the Norwell COA, with many residents participating
                just periodically, while others include visits to the Norwell COA as part of their regular weekly
                schedule. Note that participation on a weekly or more frequent basis was reported by 0% of respondents
                who are age 50-59 and 16% among those age 60-69 while 28% of those age 80 and older participate weekly,
                suggesting that older participants attend more frequently during the course of a month or a year
                (Appendix A ). Survey respondents were asked why they do not use the NCOA. For those in their 50s and
                60s, the top two reasons for not participating were that they are still working and that they report not
                being old enough to participate (see Appendix A ). Similar trends are observed among those who do NOT
                currently use the NCOA (see Figure 29 ). For those who do currently use the NCOA, still working and not
                having time were the top reasons for not attending more frequently. 19% 18% 63%Figure 28. How frequently
                do you participate at the Norwell COA? Weekly Monthly A few times/year 55 For those 19% who wrote in a
                response, the most common responses centered around not having time and still working. In addition, the
                perception of “not needing” to visit the Senior Center or “not being old enough…yet” was extracted from
                these write-in responses, suggesting that communicating the purpose of the Senior Center and defining
                its target audience is a possible future step that could draw in a wider range of residents. See Table 4
                with sample comments regarding why survey respondents don’t use the COA. It is not uncommon for
                residents to visit other, often neighboring, COAs to participate in a particular program, attend with
                friends, or simply for a change of scenery. Overall, 14% of survey respondents reported having visited
                another COA to participate in their programs. Among those in their 70s, 21% have visited other COAs and
                for those in their 80s, 19% have done so. 42% 28% 10%18% 3%18%22% 21% 7%11% 8%6%16% 15%

                the programs and services Maybe when I am retired and older I will use their services. But so glad to
                have them in town I see myself using COA in the future 57 There are a few ways that respondents were
                asked to identify their preferences for programs and services. First, respondents were asked to rate the
                importance of existing programs and services offered by the Norwell Senior Center. Figure 30 shows the
                percentage of respondents who identifed services as being very important or important to themselves or
                someone in their family. The top-rated service for respondents age 50-79 was professional services like
                health insurance counseling or notary services, which was rated important by 39-49% of respondents
                across those age groups. Among those in their 80s, the most important service provided is nutrition
                programs like lunches, grab ‘n’ go meals, and home delivered meals rated important by 41% of respondents
                in that age group. Among respondents in their 50s, the second most important service provided by the
                Norwell COA is transportation and health and wellness clinics (rated important or very important by 41%
                and 41%, respectively). For those in their 60s, nutrition programs and assistance with state and local
                programs were rated important or very important by 44% and 41% respectively. For those in their 70s,
                transportation and assistance with local and state programs were rated important or very important by
                34% and 33% respectively. For those in their 80s, transportation and health and wellness clinics were

                valued by those in their 50s and 60s (see Figure 31 ). Educational programming was rated important or
                very important by the 36% of respondents in their 70s and trips and outings were rated important or very

                important or imporant), by age category Age 50-59 Age 60-69 Age 70-79 Age 80+ 59 The second way
                respondents were asked about their preferences for programs and services was by asking them to select
                the factors that would increase likelihood of participating at the Norwell Senior Center ( Figure 32 ).
                For those who do not participate at the Norwell Senior Center (“non-users”), the most commonly reported
                factor that would increase their likelihood of participating was “If I had more knowledge about the
                programs and services offered” (39%). For those who have participated at the Norwell COA, the most
                commonly reported factor that would increase their likelihood of participating was “If programs and
                services were better suited to my interests”. Given that a sizeable share of respondents (24% of
                respondents who do NOT currently participate at the Norwell COA; and 20% of those who do participate at
                the Norwell COA) selected “other” and wrote in a factor that would increase their likelihood of
                participating, those responses were reviewed. Upon reviewing responses, the most common theme related to
                “having a need” for participation. For example, one respondent wrote “ If I could not do my current
                daily activities (I would be more likely to attend)” and a different respondent wrote they would be more
                likely to participate “If I lived alone and needed social opportunities the COA would be a valuable
                resource”. Understanding reasons for lack of participation provides direction and opportunities for
                change. Overcoming the obstacle of unfamiliarity, increasing outreach, adapting programming to meet the
                broad interests of the older adult population, and exploring strategies to update the image and space of
                the Senior Center may be areas to consider as future Norwell COA goals. 60 30% 24%23%22% 12% 6%4% 3%22%

                be more likely to use the Norwell Senior Center programs and services if..." Non User User 61 Another
                way that the survey assesses the preferences for future programming was by asking, “Thinking about your
                own future needs and interests, which of the following areas would you prioritize in expanding the
                programs available through the Norwell Senior Center”. Figure 33 illustrates how responses vary between
                those who currently participate at the Norwell Senior Center compared to those who have not yet visited
                the center. Among users, the highest priority for expanding programming was given to indoor fitness
                classes (47%), educational programming (44%), and performances, day trips, and physical health and
                wellness programs (40%). Figure 34 shows which type of services respondents would prioritize in
                expanding. Comparatively, among those who do not participate at the Norwell Senior Center, priority was
                given to indoor exercise programming (45%), educational programs (40%), and outdoor fitness
                opportunities (37%). Interestingly, 34% of non users reported an interest in lunch programs, compared to
                just 20% among users—suggesting that the addition of lunch programming could draw in new participants.
                These results indicate an overall preference for active programming that promotes physical health,
                intellectual stimulation, and active engagement in the world around them—and obviously facilities that
                would allow for such programs to be delivered comfortably and safely. 62 39%49% 41%39%42% 39%

                Survey respondents were asked the following question, “The Town of Norwell is considering a new
                multigenerational community center. What type of multigenerational community center would you support?”
                Regardless of age, there was substantial support for a center that was fully integrated for residents of
                all ages to participate in programming and access services, with 55% of all respondents responding
                favorably (see Figure 35 ). There is desire for continued availability of hybrid programs (see Figure 36
                ). For younger respondents, 45% of those in their 50s and 50% of those in their 60s prefer to
                participate remotely or in a hybrid format. Given the number of respondents who report still being in
                the workforce and busy with other commitments, this finding is expected given the flexibility of
                participating from a remote location and at varied times of day. 24%40%46%56% 71%56%49%39% 5%4%5%5% 0%

                fully integrated for residents of all ages Other 65 Communication and accessing information regarding
                activities and programs emerged as a theme from the focus groups. There was one question included on the
                survey related to preferred method of getting information. Preference for email, website, or social
                media communication varied by age (see Figure 37 ). Among respondents age 60 or older, the Senior Center
                newsletter is the most consistently preferred source of information. That share increases with each age
                category, with 79% in their 60s, 89% in their 70s, and 93% of those age 80 and older choosing the
                newsletter. Among respondents age 50-59, 64% prefer to find information about activities and services on
                the Town website. Given that current Norwell Senior Center participants are somewhat older; thus we
                conclude that continuing to make information about the Senior Center available through print media
                remains important. Considering ways to amplify the distribution of the Senior Center Newsletter in
                conjunction with expanding the existing digital presence will aid in effectively reaching both older and
                younger residents. 55%50%60%74%3%5%6%7% 42% 45%34%19% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% Age 50-59 Age

                survey respondents do have access to the Internet from their home via computer (97%), it is important to
                note that 10% of respondents age 80+ choose not to have internet access at this time (see Appendix A ).
                This is important information both for outreach mechanisms but also to highlight the need for public
                access to Internet services for those who do not have connectivity in their homes. At the conclusion of
                the survey, respondents were invited to write in any additional thoughts or comments about the Town of
                Norwell and more than 300 participants took the time to provide additional feedback. A sample of
                additional comments are presented on Table 5. The majority of the comments were praising the Norwell
                Senior Center. It is evident from the comments that while some of those who complimented the Senior
                Center take advantage of the programs and services, others do not at this time, but are comforted to
                know that the Senior Center is available for their future needs. In addition, the second most commonly
                reported topic was, again, related to the rising costs of living and property taxes in Norwell that make
                it nearly impossible for residents to age well in Norwell without significant financial means. This
                theme emerged as a top concern in every type of data collected for this project. As well, the third most
                commonly reported theme was related to ideas for additional programs and services that would be of
                interest. Some respondents provided specific ideas, such as using the COA as a location for things like
                flu shots, obtaining a transfer station sticker etc. to incentivize residents to actively go to the
                NCOA; and increase their likelihood of returning for a program or service. Coordinating with other
                departments and local organizations for music or performances, evening lectures, handy-person services,
                more gardening and exercise activities, and intergenerational opportunities were among the other
                suggestions. 68 Table 5. Additional thoughts or comments about the Town of Norwell or about current or
                future needs of older residents in Norwell COA is valued by current and future users COA was very
                helpful when first looking at Medicare. Notary service is helpful. Generally, a great resource, even if
                not one I've used a lot. Kudos to the staff for their efforts! Doing great work. I am confident that
                when the time comes, you will be a g reat resource for myself and my wife Although I don't use the NCOA
                I think it is a very worthy association and I think they do a good job meeting senior needs Recognition
                that for the COA to increase its community impact, space is needed The current COA does a great job with
                what they have to work with but the facility is inadequate. The physical space does not encourage active
                participation or desire to even participate among town residents Norwell's COA is not keeping up with
                the needs of it's agin g residents compared to neighboring towns and needs significant upgrades. Right
                now, it is the people who work at the COA that makes it exceptional.. . A better facility would be good
                Property taxes causing people to consider aging elsewhere I hope I can stay in Norwell. I raised my 4
                boys here taxes and cost of living will make it a challenge, but I enjoy living here it is HOME. I truly
                believe living in Norwell is wonderful but will become cost prohibitive to many seniors unless steps are
                taken to provide assistance and lower taxes. Suggestions for programing that would align with resident
                interests Many people think of the COA as an organization for the very elderly or needy. The COA
                building certainly doesn't help. If you have programs that draw young seniors in, you will get more
                town/center support. Offer space for socializing, talks on topics: mobility, exercises, gardening,
                men's/women's book club, diet advice (like healthy and cheap), energy conservation, real estate (reverse
                mortgages ), estate planning, tax preparation, computers / smartphones, rehabbing home for safety, local
                - state - federal help programs, education. Conclusion The population of Norwell is comprised of nearly
                one-quarter older adults; and, if they can afford to stay , growth in the number of older Norwell
                residents is expected within the next few years. This central, overarching observation—that the older
                population of Norwell is already large and will continue to expand—makes clear the importance of
                considering how well features of the Town, the services, and amenities available, and virtually every
                aspect of the community align with the age demographic moving forward. 69 Appendix A: Community Survey
