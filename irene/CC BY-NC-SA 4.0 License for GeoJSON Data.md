By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

a.  Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor.
b.  Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright, including, but not limited to, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
c.  Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
d.  Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
e.  Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
f.  Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You under the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
g.  Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.
h.  NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other Licensed Material by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial, provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the exchange.
i.  Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material without regard to time and place.
j.  Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
k.  You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your acceptance of this Public License constitutes a binding agreement.

Section 2 – Scope.

a.  License grant.
1.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
A.  reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and
B.  produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.
2.  Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
3.  Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
4.  Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
5.  Downstream recipients.
A.  Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
B.  Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
C.  No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
b.  Other rights.
1.  Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights. However, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
2.  Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
3.  To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

3.  a Creative Commons Compatible License; or
4.  a license that is designated by Creative Commons as a Creative Commons Compatible License.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a.  for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;
b.  if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in an Adapted Material, then Section 3(c) applies; and
c.  You must comply with Section 3(a) in all cases.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a.  Unless otherwise separately agreed by the Licensor, the Licensed Material is offered As-Is and As-Available, and the Licensor makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.
b.  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for direct, incidental, or consequential damages, so this exclusion or limitation may not apply to You.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a.  This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
b.  Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
1.  automatically as of the date the violation is corrected, provided it is corrected within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
2.  upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
c.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
d.  Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

a.  The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
b.  Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

a.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.
b.  To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
c.  No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
d.  Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
