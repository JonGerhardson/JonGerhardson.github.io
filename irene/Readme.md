Map displays one unique point for every one camera. Multisensor/360 cams are counted once per lens because this is how Chicopee PD counts them in their audit logs, and on their website. In the course of preparing this story, I observed the foloowing increases in listed camera numbers per connectchicopee.org:

```
Timestamp,URL,Registered Cameras,Integrated Cameras
2025-07-09 15:55:06,https://connectchicopee.org/,56,476
2025-07-13 19:29:43,https://connectchicopee.org/,66,476
```

"Registered" cameras are not counted in this map, nor are body/dash cameras. It is unclear if that would explain the difference in numbers. 

Camera locatiions are approxinmate based on a combination of in-person observations, and public records. To obtain GPS coordinates presumed or known addresses for cameras were gecoded using an API service. In most cases this location was derived from location_name in Axon Fusus audit logs. In one special circumstance, Szot Park, where cameras are spread out over a larger area represented by one address, multiple points within that zone were added semi-ranomly after in-person obsevation. This was done for the purpose of showing the distribution of cameras but does not nessecarily map any particular camera to it's exact GPS coordinates. The bath house camera may appear in the football field, etc. Other locations were updated if an object_name corresponded to a known address.
