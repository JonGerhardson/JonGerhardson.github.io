        "unmet_needs": "Yes, many needs. Our towns are getting very small amounts of money due to their status as members of regional school districts. There is a strong interest in funding primary prevention including Second Step in many elementary schools, and PreVenture and Restorative Practices work in middle and hig schools, but we do not get enough funding to do that.",
        "orrf_recommendations": "Prevention work in schools, especially Restorative Practices Please support more recovery capital in rural areas. Please provide additional funding, points for towns in regional school district since they lost so much in the national formula Please do not disqualify agencies from applying due to their large budget -- in rural regions there are few host agencies, and so many functions end up being under one roof (e.g. The Consortium, Tapestry health Services), but the little recovery support projects they do do not benefit from the other funding and are hurt by the arbitrary RIZE budget size cutoff."
