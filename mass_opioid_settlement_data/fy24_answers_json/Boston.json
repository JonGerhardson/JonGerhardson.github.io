The coverage for staff time and associated fringe costs amounts to approximately $80K. The City of Boston and Boston Public Health Commission has launched multiple projects and contracts as of the beginning of FY25, using settlements funds. A $1M grant program is funding five organizations $200K each to distribute naloxone, expand overdose prevention education, and link people to care. The organizations are Bridge Over Troubled Waters, Community Caring Clinic, Harvard Street Neighborhood Health Center, Metro Boston Alive, and Torchlight Recovery. Boston is in the process of awarding $375K to Boston BullPen, supporting an emergency fund providing financial support to families after the death of a family member to opioid overdose. $745K in settlements funding provides harm reduction EMTs in City shelters to prevent overnight overdoses. Boston is also funding Newmarket Business Improvement District to run a low-threshold work program called Back2Work in the Mass/Cass area, providing employment services and picking up littered syringes. Boston is funding Boston Health Care for the Homelessness $368K to operate a medical clinic which also prescribes medications for opioid use disorder. Finally, Boston is funding a Community Affairs Specialist approximately $87K, including salary and fringe, to assist in implementing settlements-related projects and also expand community engagement and community overdose prevention.",
