We collected public feedback via stakeholder interviews, public survey, and open meetings. We formed a Committee of local leaders and those with lived experience to provide funding recommendations. We are in the final process of contracting and delivering the first round of grant funding. This activity will be shown in our FY2025 expenditure reporting. The City is committed to transparency and provides updates via our webpage on our opioid settlement funds here: https://fallriverma.gov/departments/health_and_human_services/fall_river_opioid_settlement_funds.php",
