        "general": "The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and Plymouth Department of Health and Human Services is strongly committed to ensuring the Opioid Remediation Fund is utilized to help individuals / families recover from the tragic impacts of substance abuse. The Opioid Settlement initiative is a powerful first step to move this public health crisis from what has previously been an awareness campaign to implementation of critical services and healing recovery programs. Scaling this effort will take time. Listening and learning from community members and individuals negatively impacted is the fundamental first step in the constructing an effective strategy. Identifying, coordinating, and integrating service providers is essential. The infrastructure of most municipal public health offices does not possess the internal capacity or relationships to immediately rollout a comprehensive program that is required. Local public health is reliant on external partnerships and collaborations, with a diverse cross-section of specialties, to address the deep and often complex needs. Skilled communication, mutually beneficial collaborations, timely data tracking, and reasonable evaluation metrics all need to be firmly established before any measurable traction can be achieved. Like any large-scale and complex program of this magnitude, measurable success will require a linear focus and firm determination. In this work. succuss is accomplished one individual, one family at a time. However, this public health crisis is winnable! The affected individuals and families are deserving of the healing and recovery services this effort will deliver. Plymouth HHS is profoundly grateful for this funding and fully understands the responsibility and recovery and well-being that must be restored. We are confident local public health officials, working in conjunction with the Commonwealth of Mass, will meet the challenge before them.",
        "unmet_needs": "Yes. Plymouth HHS launched its first phase of settlement funding in the Spring of 24'. After a series of Community Listening Sessions and online survey, a Request for Proposals (RFP) was released in February. Submissions were scored by a diverse team of leaders within this discipline and five grants were successfully awarded to local service providers in April. The five grant funds awarded totaled $250K. The awarding of five community grants was only the first tier of multi-layer strategic plan. Each grantee is required to submit quarterly reporting, which is assessed and evaluated for targeted progress. Ongoing and unmet needs are currently being evaluated. There are significantly more needs of local individuals suffering from substance abuse that must be addressed. Much of this work is achieved one individual / family at a time. Progress is deeply complex and often slow. The cycle and nature of recovery requires consent attention as this disorder is commonly accompanied by trauma and a comprehensive approach that considers the individual's physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual needs. Plymouth, like many communities, continues to suffer the on-going and increasing negative impacts of substance abuse. Moving forward, Plymouth HHS is working to identify, develop, and assemble the next chapter of needed services in its program portfolio. Plymouth HHS is presently planning a Spring Conference in 25' to help shape next steps. Plymouth is fortunate to have numerous reliable and accomplished local nonprofits and service providers to help us in this work. They are helping make our goals a reality and supporting people in their journey to recovery.",
        "orrf_recommendations": "The seven allowable strategies outlined in the Municipal Agreement comprehensively address the complex issues confronting progress in this work. This service framework of priorities is a good starting point to build upon as the program matures at both the State and local level. Each community however must evaluate and assess the unique balance and configuration of strategies to best serve their community, and the well-being of individuals impacted. There are certainly well recognized \"best practices\" in this work but the make-up, balance, and application of each must be evaluated at the local level. Sharing successes among communities can certainly expedite progress and healing. The discipline of Public Health is built on PREVENTION. It is a central theme. Proactive interventions along with clear, reliable community messaging must be a spending priority. Like many issues in public health, long term results in human behavior take time. Prevention strategies should be a top priority."
