These residents have been historically disadvantaged by race, wealth, and stigma. We address those barriers by having our Street Community Outreach workers connect them to wrap around services at the local Lawrence General Hospital and Health Center. Some outreach workers assisted in filling out Mass health applications and connected them to the appropriate health services navigator at the hospital for additional services. We will continue to work with our Street Outreach Team, Hospital, and the Police Department to provide wrap around services."
