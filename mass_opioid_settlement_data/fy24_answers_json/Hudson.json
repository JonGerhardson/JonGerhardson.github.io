We will make stronger outreach efforts in the future in order to hear from more members of the community, particularly these groups, in order to best assess and identify gaps. Despite this, from our research, we do know that there are very limited resources/services offered locally in any languages other than English, thus we know that is a major gap. We also know that transportation is a major barrier across the board, thus we can only assume it is even more so of a barrier for people of a lower SES."
