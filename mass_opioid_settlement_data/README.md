The original municipal data for FY2023 and FY2024 is avaialble as csv files from this repo. In the FY2024 csv, some survey responses are truncated due to what I beleive was an export error by DPH when they provided it. For this reason, I converted the full PDF survey responses to JSON, which are also available in this repo. Besides from those surveys, everything available through the website is stored in opioid_settlement.db, including FY2025 municipal data. 

I'll try to add a more throrough technical writeup about this at some point in the future. If in doubt about the accuracy of any information, get it from the source by sending a records request to RAO.DPH.mass.gov. I am not a state employee or any way associated with any secretariat of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
