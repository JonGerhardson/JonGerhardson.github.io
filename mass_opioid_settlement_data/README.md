Several hours after this went live, I noticed a bug that nulled out the expenditures column for FY2024. It has been fixed as of 12:30 p.m. Feb. 12, 2026. 

If you find any bugs with how data is displayed on the dashboard please email jon.gerhardson@proton.me or open an issue on github. 

The original municipal data for FY2023 and FY2024 is avaialble as csv files from this repo. In the FY2024 csv, some survey responses are truncated due to what I beleive was an export error by DPH when they provided it. For this reason, I converted the full PDF survey responses to JSON, which are also available in this repo. Besides from those surveys, everything available through the website is stored in opioid_settlement.db, including FY2025 municipal data. 

I'll try to add a more throrough technical writeup about this at some point in the future. If in doubt about the accuracy of any information, get it from the source by sending a records request to RAO.DPH.mass.gov. I am not a state employee or any way associated with any secretariat of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
